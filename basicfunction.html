    <h2>What are javascript functions?</h2>

        <p>(In this picture, a called addNumbers(a,b) is created. It takes in 2 values as inputs: a and b. When this function gets called on, it will return a + b, the sum of the 2 numbers.)</p>

    <h2>How to write a function?</h2>
    <p>The first step is to define the function. When defining a function, the keyword <b>'function'</b> must be used. By stating that you are declaring a function, the interpreter will know what you are doing.</p>
    <p>The second step is to name your function. It should represent what your function is going to do. Using the example from above, the name: addNumbers, clearly describes the purpose of the function</p>
    <p>After function is declared and name is assigned, depending on the function itself, the parameters inside the parentheses are passed down to the body as arugements that gives you the desired output.</p>
    <h3>And there you have it! A simple function! Try one yourself!</h3>
    <h2>Remember functions only run when you call it. How do we call to functions? There are many ways. One way is to simply type the function name, parentheses and a semicolon. Look at the picture below:</h2>
