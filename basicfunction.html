    <span>
        <p>(In this picture, a called addNumbers(a,b) is created. It takes in 2 values as inputs: a and b. When this function gets called on, it will return a + b, the sum of the 2 numbers.)</p>
    </span>
    <h2>How to write a function?</h2>
    <p>The first step is to define the function. When defining a function, the keyword <b>'function'</b> must be used. By stating that you are declaring a function, the interpreter will know what you are doing.</p>
    <p>The second step is to name your function. It should represent what your function is going to do. Using the example from above, the name: addNumbers, clearly describes the purpose of the function</p>
    <p>After function is declared and name is assigned, depending on the function itself, inside the parenthese, you can put parameters that are pass down as arguements to the code part of the function that gives you the desired output.</p>
