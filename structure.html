    <h1>Ways to structure your html:</h1>
    <h3>Basic Structural Tags</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>The &lt;p&gt; tag is a paragraph that sets up a section of screen for text.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/ptag.png" alt="p tag">
    <ul>
        <li><p> Div tag and span tag are also another way to section text. The difference between them is that div is a <b>block element(linebreaks before and after)</b> while span is an <b>inline element(no linebreaks).</b> Read more below.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <div>
        <p>Divs and ps are block elements. They always start on a new line and take up as much horizontal space as possible. 
            On the other hand, the span tag is inline elements. They only take up as much space as the content itself. 
        </p>
    </div>
        <h3>Indentation!</h3>
        <p>While the browser doesn't care about indentation. It is important to include indentation to make the program easier to read and understand.</p>

        <h3>HTML Entities</h3>
        <p>Sometimes, when a HTML text includes the less than or greater than sign, the browser might mix them with tags. To fix this issue, you would use something called entities.  
        </p>
        <div>
            <p>Here are some examples:
                <ul>
                    <li><p> < (less than) = &amp;lt;</p></li> </p></li>
                    <li><p> > (greater than) = &amp;gt;</p></li> </p></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <img src="images\than.png" alt="Entities Usage Example">
        </div>
   
   
   
        <p>All HTML documents must start with this tag. It tells the browser about what document type to expect, an in this case: HTML.</p>
   <h3>html Elements</h3>
   <p>The root element of this HTML page. All other elements are descendants of this element. Make sure to use lowercase letters. Upper case are outdated.</p>
   <h3>head tag</h3>
   <p>Contains the metadata about the document. It is a descendants of the html tag.</p>
   <h3>body tag</h3>
   <p>This contains all the content of the HTML page.</p>
   <h3>Everything Else:</h3>
